# Tune Log

Tune Log is designed to show a discography and a biography of my producer career as dEEGE. Here you will be able to get a sense of my style and where it comes from. You will learn how long I've been doing music and my passion for it, as well as the future of dEEGE. The main target of audience would be artists looking for beats to record vocals on, or other producers for inspiration or potential future collaborations. View the live website [here]()

Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
Validator Testing

    HTML
        No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
    CSS
        No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

    The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
        In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
        From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
        Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
