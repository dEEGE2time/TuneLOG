# Tune Log

Tune Log is designed to show a discography and a biography of my producer career as dEEGE. Here you will be able to get a sense of my style and where it comes from. You will learn how long I've been doing music and my passion for it, as well as the future of dEEGE. The main target of audience would be artists looking for beats to record vocals on, or other producers for inspiration or potential future collaborations.

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.
Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

    The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
        In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
        From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
        Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
